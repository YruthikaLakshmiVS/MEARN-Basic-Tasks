        <b>Artificial Intelligence</b>
        refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think and act like humans. It
        involves the development of algorithms and computer programs that can perform tasks that typically require human
        intelligence such as visual perception, speech recognition, decision-making, and language translation. AI has
        the potential to revolutionize many industries and has a wide range of applications, from virtual personal
        assistants to self-driving cars
    </p>
    <p>
        Before leading to the meaning of artificial intelligence let understand what is the meaning of Intelligence-
    </p>
    <p>
        <mark>Intelligence :</mark>
        The ability to learn and solve problems. This definition is taken from webster’s Dictionary.

            <em>
                The most common answer that one expects is “to make computers intelligent so that they can act
                intelligently!”, but the question is how much intelligent? How can one judge intelligence?
                …as intelligent as humans. If the computers can, somehow, solve real-world problems, by improving on
                their
                own from past experiences, they would be called “intelligent”.
                Thus, the AI systems are more generic(rather than specific), can “think” and are more flexible.

        Intelligence, as we know, is the ability to acquire and apply knowledge. Knowledge is the information acquired
        through experience. Experience is the knowledge gained through exposure(training). Summing the terms up, we get
        artificial intelligence as the “copy of something natural(i.e., human beings) ‘WHO’ is capable of acquiring and
        applying the information it has gained through exposure.”
    </p>
    <h3>Intelligence is composed of:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Reasoning</li>
        <li>Learning</li>
        <li>Problem-Solving</li>
        <li>Perception</li>
        <li>Linguistic Intelligence</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Many tools are used in AI, including versions of search and mathematical optimization, logic, and methods based
        on probability and economics. The AI field draws upon computer science, mathematics, psychology, linguistics,
        philosophy, neuroscience, artificial psychology, and many others.
    </p>
    <p>
        The main focus of artificial intelligence is towards understanding human behavior and performance. This can be
        done by creating computers with human-like intelligence and capabilities. This includes natural language
        processing, facial analysis and robotics. The main applications of AI are in military, healthcare, and
        computing; however, it’s expected that these applications will start soon and become part of our everyday lives.

        The earliest substantial work in the field of artificial intelligence was done in the mid-20th century by the
        British logician and computer pioneer Alan Mathison Turing. In 1935 Turing described an abstract computing
        machine consisting of a limitless memory and a scanner that moves back and forth through the memory, symbol by
        symbol, reading what it finds and writing further symbols. The actions of the scanner are dictated by a program
        of instructions that also is stored in the memory in the form of symbols. This is Turing’s stored-program
        concept, and implicit in it is the possibility of the machine operating on, and so modifying or improving, its
        own program. Turing’s conception is now known simply as the universal Turing machine. All modern computers are
        in essence universal Turing machines.
